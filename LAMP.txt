sudo yum update -y

sudo amazon-linux-extras install php8.2

sudo yum install -y httpd

sudo systemctl start httpd

sudo systemctl enable httpd

sudo systemctl is-enabled httpd

To set file permissions
Add your user (in this case, ec2-user) to the apache group.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo usermod -a -G apache ec2-user

Log out and then log back in again to pick up the new group, and then verify your membership.

Log out (use the exit command or close the terminal window):


[ec2-user ~]$ exit
To verify your membership in the apache group, reconnect to your instance, and then run the following command:


[ec2-user ~]$ groups
ec2-user adm wheel apache systemd-journal
Change the group ownership of /var/www and its contents to the apache group.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
To add group write permissions and to set the group ID on future subdirectories, change the directory permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo chmod 2775 /var/www && find /var/www -type d -exec sudo chmod 2775 {} \;
To add group write permissions, recursively change the file permissions of /var/www and its subdirectories:


[ec2-user ~]$ find /var/www -type f -exec sudo chmod 0664 {} \;
Now, ec2-user (and any future members of the apache group) can add, delete, and edit files in the Apache document root, enabling you to add content, such as a static website or a PHP application.



To install phpMyAdmin
Install the required dependencies.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install php-mbstring php-xml -y
Restart Apache.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl restart httpd
Restart php-fpm.


[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
Navigate to the Apache document root at /var/www/html.


[ec2-user ~]$ cd /var/www/html
Select a source package for the latest phpMyAdmin release from https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads. To download the file directly to your instance, copy the link and paste it into a wget command, as in this example:


[ec2-user html]$ wget https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/phpMyAdmin-latest-all-languages.tar.gz
Create a phpMyAdmin folder and extract the package into it with the following command.


[ec2-user html]$ mkdir phpMyAdmin && tar -xvzf phpMyAdmin-latest-all-languages.tar.gz -C phpMyAdmin --strip-components 1
Delete the phpMyAdmin-latest-all-languages.tar.gz tarball.


[ec2-user html]$ rm phpMyAdmin-latest-all-languages.tar.gz
